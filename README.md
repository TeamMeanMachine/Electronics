# Team 2471 Custom PCBs

## NOTE:
Most of our PCBs require the Digikey PCB Library available at https://github.com/Digi-Key/digikey-kicad-library as well as the Sparkfun libraries available at https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-KiCad-Libraries

They also frequently require the library files contained in the `Core` folder of this repository
